Really great work throughout! Thanks for the lovely markdown formatting, and really great work on the advanced exercises! 

One small note â€“ In Exercise 5.D, you use grep to search for AF=1. This does indeed get you all matches to that phrase, but it gets you both rows with allele frequency of 1 (AF=1), and rows with allele frequency not equal to 1 but superpopulation allele frequency equal to 1 (e.g. AF=0.92; SAS_AF=1). How could you search just for lines where the global allele frequency is 1?
