This all looks good. Your comments for the VCF parser are clear and suggest that you understand what each part of the code is doing and why. Your annotation scipt also looks pretty good. You appear to have a grasp of dictionaries and how to use them in your code. There are several things in your script that are redundant or just don't need to be there. For example, you first create lists for the dbSnp positions and IDs, followed by adding them to a dictionary. While this approach works, it is just adding complexity. You can create the dictionary in that first for loop with `SNP_ID[each[1]] = each[2]`. There is also no need for the list `filt_ran_snp`, but I suspect that was for debugging purposes. However, your code works, which is the important part. You're doing great. Keep it up!
