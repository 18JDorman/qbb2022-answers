Really really great work. Looks like it's missing just one thing:
1. It looks like you're running the same model twice: fpkm regressed onto stage. In your second model, you should be regressing fpkm onto stage AND sex. (-0.5 point)
2. After running the above regression, make sure you comapre the set of significant genes between the two models (i.e. % overlap) (-0.5 point)
3. You volcano plot should be from the second model with sex as a covariate (no points deducted)

Awesome job!
