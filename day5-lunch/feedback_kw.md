## Exercise 1

Nice work with data wrangling in both unix and python and great job recording what you did!

## Exercise 2

### 1 -- data input


Great!

### 2 -- scatter plots

Good plots and labels overall! I would recommend switching your axes since you will be using this data for a linear regression and the independent variable is commonly on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis.


### 3 & 4 -- OLS

Fantastic!


### 5 -- histogram

Great histogram!

### 6 -- ttest


Great work!

### 7 -- predict

Good work predicting!
